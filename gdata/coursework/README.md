##Tidying up the Data

All work done tidying up the data is accomplished by the "run_analysis.r" script

The script should be run in the same directory where all the accompanying files for this coursework are located

The script returns a clean tidy data set called "final_data_set" with 4 columns: "subject", "activity", "variables" and "average".
